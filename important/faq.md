# F-A-Q

## Where do I post images ? 

* You have many choice to post images, each channel have specific topic like **\#d-player-room** or **\#d-creator-room**, if you have a picture that doesn't fit any of the topic of the actual channels, post them here \#d-media 
* Mods or higher can upload images in **\#general-chat**

## How can I access requests chats ?

* To access **\#d-challenge-request** chat you will need to be Lv. 5 or more  note : it's Lv. 5 on Mee6 leaderboard  
* To access **\#d-level-request** chat you will need to be Lv. 10 or more, the room will also be open if you have the "**@ðŸ›  D.Creators \[&gt;2 Cp\]"** or **"@ðŸ’ŽD.Sexy creator"** role  ****note : Same as the previous message but with Lv. 10  

## How can I advertise my levels or personal stuffs ?

You will need to be Lv.10 to access **\#d-advertising** 

## **How my warnings could be removed ?**

First of all, you will need to know that warns can only removed with staff agreement. At least we put minimal days of punishment, after that you only need to review your behavior  
  
**Warning I** last 1 week  
**Warning II** last 2 weeks   
**Warning III** last 3 weeks   
  
Note : **Warning I** mutes you for 30m; **Warning II** mutes you for 2h and **Warning III** mutes you for 4h

## Can I tag "X" staff member ?

Of course! If you need any help, we will be glad to answer you!  
But you shouldn't tag staff roles \(set aside for emergency\) and also ping because it's ~~_**FUNNY**_~~
